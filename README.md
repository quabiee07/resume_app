## Design Choice

I chose this [Design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/147520385/Developer-Portfolio-design?tracking_source=search_projects%7Cweb+developer+website+design) because I was going for a minimalistic approach. Added a little bit of my imagination for originality.

## Depndencies

- [flutter_svg](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg): This package was used to load all svg assets
- [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher): This package was used to launch my social media links in a webview
- [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider): This package was used to manage the state of my application

### Bonus Features if I had more time

Below are some features i would've loved to add to the project if i had more time:
- A project screens which displays a list of projects i done.
- Localization

## Challenges 

- Animating the splash screen was quite challanging. Subtly animating the logo proved difficult untill i took am look at the [Docs on Animation](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets/animation) and found a list of animations to choose from.
